# Component Library with Storybook

Datahub Explorer is a REACT-driven system that provides viewing capabilities for end users. This release is for DHS environments only.
This project is the web service that serves content to explorer-ui.


# Getting Started
Explorer is distributed as a group of three Docker containers, one of which contains the UI environment, one of which contains the backed, 
and the third contains MarkLogic and is only packaged as a convenience and is only intended for demo use.

The customer is expected to use a complete MarkLogic installation, as supported by Data Hub Services rather than the containerized version. 
That version is not supported for any purpose other than demonstration. 

## Development Setup

Below are the commands to start the Data Hub Explorer UI

```
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the UI development environment
npm start

# Setup the backend development environment
Follow the README instructions to build and run the server locally from command line
https://project.marklogic.com/repo/projects/PROD/repos/datahubenterprise/browse?at=refs%2Fheads%2Fdevelop
```

## Build Docker Container

Make sure you have docker installed on your local system.

```
# Build Docker image
docker build -t explorer-ui .

# Run Docker container
Replace API_URL with server IP
docker run -e API_URL=172.0.1.0:8080 -e SSL_CERT=/etc/nginx/www.explorer.com.cert.pem -e SSL_KEY=/etc/nginx/www.explorer.com.key.pem -p 80:80 -p 443:443 explorer-ui

# Build and Run the backend Docker container
